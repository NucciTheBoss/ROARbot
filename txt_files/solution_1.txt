Ah! Looks like you forgot to specify the allocation you are submitting your job to. Donâ€™t worry, you can fix this by adding the following line to your pbs script:

  #PBS -A open

If you have an allocation you want to submit your job to, just modify the above pbs directive to the following:

  #PBS -A <allocation_name>
